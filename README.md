### Project Description
**CRAZY WINDOW SIMULATOR** - A GUI Window acts abnormally. It definitely measures your tolerance.

   - Absolutely useless.
   - Tests your patience.
   - Made in Java.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are really fast in controlling the application windows, especially if something fishy is doing there. This saves them a lot at many circumstances.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We just changed the controls of window so its not easier to control it. It will create a bit of confusion.
